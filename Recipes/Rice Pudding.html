        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Rice pudding is a creamy mixture of rice and milk that is cooked until it's thick and soft. It can be sweet or savory. This raisin-studded dessert rice pudding is thickened with an egg, sweetened with sugar, and enhanced with vanilla.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1½ cups cold water</li>
                <li>¾ cup uncooked white rice</li>
                <li>2 cups milk, divided</li>
                <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>⅔ cup golden raisins</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour water into a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat; stir in rice. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine cooked rice, 1 1/2 cups milk, sugar, and salt in a clean saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring often, until thick and creamy, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in remaining 1/2 cup milk, beaten egg, and raisins; cook 2 minutes more, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in butter and vanilla until combined; serve warm.</li>
